**I.	Introduction**

This cookie policy (this “Cookie Policy”) explains how the Jito Foundation (“we”, “us,” or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit the website available at www.jito.network (the “Site”). This Cookie Policy explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights with respect to the use of these technologies. In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. For more details on how we process your personal information, please review our Privacy Policy.

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will change the Last Updated date above. We encourage you to periodically review the Cookie Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.

**II.	What are cookies?**

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Site, may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through your use of the Site.

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their website function, work more efficiently, or provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Site (e.g., like advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or device when it visits the website in question.

**III.	Why do we use cookies?**

We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us to understand the interests of our website visitors and users to enhance the user experience on our Sites. Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for our own advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below. The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Site you visit).

Our uses of these Technologies generally facilitate the following:

● Allow you access to the Site, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity, improve security, or allow you to make use of our functionality;

● Assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how individuals use the Site;

● Offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using the Site, which may include identifying you when you use the Site or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;

● Deliver content, through first or third party services, including ads relevant to your interests, on the Site or on third-party digital properties; and

● Process analytics information on the Site to allow us to better understand how the Site is used and to continually improve and personalize the Site.

**IV.	What about other web tracking technologies?**

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an email from us. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns to our Sites, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to improve Site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functionality.
