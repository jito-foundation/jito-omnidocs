## Before You Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Solana wallet connected (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Sufficient assets for deposit (e.g. SOL or JitoSOL)
- Small amount of SOL for transaction fees
- Understanding of restaking risks and two-epoch withdrawal cooldown

**Important Reminders:**
- The (re)staking protocol charges a 4% fee on rewards and 0.1% (10 bps) withdrawal fee
- Individual vaults may have additional deposit, withdrawal, and reward fees
- Operators may also apply fees for their services.  
- Program fee of 0.10% also applies on withdrawals (as shown in interface)
- Start with small amounts to learn the interface and mechanics
- Always check vault-specific fee structures before depositing

## Step 1: Access the Restaking Interface

1. Navigate to [jito.network/restaking/](https://www.jito.network/restaking/)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select your wallet type and approve connection
4. Ensure you're on the correct network (Solana mainnet)

## Step 2: Choose Your Approach

The (re)staking interface provides a convenient toggle to switch between two deposit approaches:

![Restaking Deposit - Asset Selection](/shared/images/jitosol/restaking-start-restaking-asset-view.png)

**Path 1: Select Asset First (Tokens Tab)**
- Choose your token (SOL, JitoSOL, etc.) from your wallet
- Browse vaults that support your selected asset
- Compare strategies and expected returns

**Path 2: Select Vault First (Vaults Tab)**  
- Browse all available vaults and their strategies
- Choose based on NCNs, operators, and risk profile
- Deposit any supported asset into the selected vault

**Vault Selection Criteria:**
- **Strategy Type:** Single vs multi-asset support
- **Risk Level:** Conservative (established) vs aggressive (newer NCNs)
- **Supported Assets:** Ensure your tokens are compatible
- **Fee Structure:** Compare deposit, withdrawal, and reward fees
- **Performance:** Review current and historical returns

**Key Vault Information:**
- Current reward sources (base staking + NCN rewards)
- Vault capacity and current utilization levels
- Underlying NCNs (oracles, bridges, L2s) and their operators
- Security audit status and vault age/maturity

## Step 3: Choose Your Vault

**For Beginners:**
- Look for established vaults with proven track records
- Choose single-asset vaults to start (simpler mechanics)
- Prefer vaults with longer operational history
- Avoid experimental strategies or newly launched NCNs

**Vault Details Page:**
- Click on a vault to see detailed information
- Review strategy explanation and mechanics
- Check recent performance and metrics
- Read risk disclosures carefully

## Step 4: Enter Deposit Details

![(Re)staking Deposit - Enter Amount](/shared/images/jitosol/restaking-start-restaking-start-deposit-screen.png)

**Specify Deposit Amount:**
- Enter the amount of assets you want to deposit in the input field
- The interface shows your current wallet balance for reference
- Use the "Max" button to deposit your full balance
- Ensure you meet minimum deposit requirements
- Keep some SOL for transaction fees

**Asset Exchange Information:**
- The interface displays exchange rates (e.g., "1 JitoSOL â‰ˆ 0.998 ezSOL")
- Shows how much VRT tokens ("To Receive") you'll get for your deposit
- VRT amounts represent your proportional share in the vault

**Multi-Asset Vault Considerations:**
- If the vault supports multiple assets, choose which tokens to deposit
- Check the vault's current asset allocation targets
- Consider any rebalancing that may be needed

## Step 5: Review and Confirm

![Restaking Deposit - Review and Confirm](/shared/images/jitosol/restaking-start-restaking-confirm-deposit-screen.png)

**Review Transaction Details:**
- Verify your deposit amount and selected asset
- Check the vault details including NCNs and Node Operators
- Review deposit fee (often 0% as shown)
- Confirm VRT tokens you'll receive (e.g., "0.199570065 ezSOL")
- Note any applicable fees

**Vault Information Display:**
- **Node Consensus Networks (NCNs):** Shows which networks your deposit will help secure (e.g., TipRouter)
- **Node Operators:** Lists the infrastructure providers (e.g., Helius, Pier Two, Temporal)
- **Deposit Fee:** Usually 0% for deposits
- **Fee Amount:** Shows exact fee calculation

**Execute Deposit Transaction:**
- Click "Deposit and Mint VRT" to proceed
- Your wallet will prompt for transaction approval
- Pay the required transaction fees (in SOL)
- Wait for blockchain confirmation (usually 2-20 seconds)


## Step 6: Verify Your Position

**Check Your VRT Balance:**
- VRT tokens should appear in your wallet automatically
- Verify you received the expected VRT amount based on your deposit
- Note the VRT token address and amount for future reference
- VRT tokens represent your proportional share of the vault

**Access Your Dashboard:**

![Restaking Dashboard - My Vaults](/shared/images/jitosol/restaking-dashboard-my-vaults-vrts.png)

- Navigate to [jito.network/restaking/dashboard/](https://www.jito.network/restaking/dashboard/)
- Your dashboard shows all active positions under "My Vaults"
- Each row displays:
  - **Vault Name** (e.g., bzSOL Vault, rstSOL Vault)
  - **VRT Balance** (your vault receipt tokens)
  - **Staked Asset Equivalent** (underlying asset amount)
  - **USD Value** of your position
  - **Initiate Withdrawal** button for each position

**Position Tracking:**
- Monitor your underlying asset allocation within each vault
- Track position values and equivalent asset amounts
- Watch for vault strategy changes or announcements
- Use the dashboard to manage multiple vault positions simultaneously

## Understanding Your VRT Tokens

**What VRTs Represent:**
- Your proportional ownership share of the vault's total assets
- Proof of deposit in the restaking protocol
- Claim on underlying assets and any accrued rewards
- Required for managing your position and future withdrawals

**VRT Token Usage:**
Your VRT tokens can be:
- **Held to maintain** your restaking position and earn rewards
- **Used in supported DeFi applications** for additional yield opportunities
- **Transferred between wallets** if needed for management
- **Burned to withdraw** your original assets (with two-epoch cooldown)

**Important VRT Guidelines:**
- Store VRT tokens securely in your wallet
- Never lose access to your VRT tokens (they're required for withdrawals)
- Check compatibility before using VRTs in external DeFi protocols

This guide covers the basic deposit process. For withdrawal instructions, see the [Restaking Withdrawal Guide](/jitosol/user-guides/restaking/restaking-withdrawal-guide/). Always do your own research and understand the risks before depositing significant amounts.
