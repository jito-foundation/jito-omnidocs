## Jupiter

Jupiter ([jup.ag](http://jup.ag)) is the recommended venue for any purchases or sales of JitoSOL. The exchange aggregates liquidity across the entire Solana network and suggests the best route based on sizing and token pairs. Trades can also be split automatically across multiple routes if that provides better execution. Jupiter does not currently charge fees. See [here](https://docs.jup.ag/community-guides/how-to-use-jupiter) for additional Jupiter instruction.

After navigating to the site, connect your wallet and enter the payment token (USDC, SOL, etc.) along with JitoSOL in the "You Receive" section. Click "Swap" and the trade will be immediately executed.

Check the trade price and ensure there is not a slippage warning for poor execution. If you receive this notice, consider reducing your trade size or minting JitoSOL directly on our website with no slippage.

## Alternate Venues

JitoSOL is available directly from [Orca](https://www.orca.so/).  Note Jupiter integrates these pools so no need to visit Orca or any other venue directly.
