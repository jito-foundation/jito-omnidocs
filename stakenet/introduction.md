# Introduction to StakeNet

StakeNet is Jito's decentralized network of validators that power the JitoSOL liquid staking protocol. This network of high-quality validators ensures the security, performance, and decentralization of the Jito ecosystem.

## What is StakeNet?

StakeNet is a curated network of Solana validators that:

- Receive stake from the JitoSOL liquid staking pool
- Run Jito's MEV-enabled validator software
- Follow Jito's operational standards and best practices
- Contribute to the security and performance of the network

## Key Features

### Decentralized Security

StakeNet enhances network security through:

- Geographic distribution across multiple regions
- Diverse infrastructure providers
- Strict operational security requirements
- Regular security audits and monitoring

### MEV Extraction

StakeNet validators participate in the Jito MEV ecosystem by:

- Running the Jito block engine
- Processing transaction bundles from searchers
- Optimizing block construction for value extraction
- Sharing MEV rewards with stakers

### Performance Standards

All StakeNet validators must meet high performance standards:

- Minimum 99.5% uptime requirement
- Low block production latency
- Sufficient hardware specifications
- Regular performance monitoring

## StakeNet Economics

The economic model of StakeNet balances rewards between validators and stakers:

- Validators receive a portion of standard staking rewards
- MEV rewards are shared between validators, stakers, and the protocol
- Commission rates are standardized across the network
- Additional incentives for high-performing validators

## Become a StakeNet Validator

1. Review the [validator requirements](/stakenet/validators/requirements)
2. Set up your validator with the [setup guide](/stakenet/validators/setup)
3. Apply to join the network through the [application process](/stakenet/validators/application)

## StakeNet Governance

The StakeNet validator set is governed through:

- On-chain governance via JITO token voting
- Regular performance reviews
- Transparent scoring and ranking system
- Community-driven validator selection
