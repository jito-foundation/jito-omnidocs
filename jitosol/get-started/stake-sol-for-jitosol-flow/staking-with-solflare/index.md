This guide covers how to stake SOL for JitoSOL using Solflare wallet. The process takes just a few minutes and allows you to start earning both staking and MEV rewards.

**Time Required:** 2-5 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Solflare wallet with SOL tokens and small amount for transaction fees

## Prerequisites

### **Getting SOL for Staking**

Your wallet needs some balance of SOL to stake. If you want to purchase SOL and already have assets in your wallet, use [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) to swap for SOL. For those without existing assets on Solana, SOL can be purchased through exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or most popular venues. After purchasing SOL and setting up a Solana wallet, transfer the SOL into your wallet.

## Step 1: Connect Your Solflare Wallet

Navigate to [jito.network/staking](https://jito.network/staking/) and connect your wallet:
