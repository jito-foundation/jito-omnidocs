## Overview

### The Vault Account:

- Serves as the repository for supported token and VRT (Vault Receipt Token).
- Tracks the state of tokens deposits, withdrawals, and delegate assets.
- Manages a set of administrative roles, responsible for different aspects of vault operations.

### Key functionalities include:

- Token Management: Handles deposits, withdrawals, and minting/burning of VRT tokens with fee calculations and slippage protection.
- Fee Management: Supports dynamic fee adjustments (deposit, withdrawal, reward) with built-in validation and limits.
- Delegation Management: Tracks and manages the delegation of assets to operators, ensuring sufficient reserves for withdrawals.
- State Tracking: Maintains a detailed record of vault activity, including cooldowns, ready-to-claim amounts, and delegation states.
- Administrative Role Management: Assigns and verifies various admin roles (e.g., delegation admin, fee admin) for secure and efficient operations.
