**Stake Status:**
- **Active**: Earning rewards, needs unstaking
- **Unstaked**: Ready to withdraw
- Various validators with different APY rates

## Step 5: Unstake Active Stakes

For stakes showing as **"Active"**:

1. Click on the active stake account to see validator details and APY

4. Confirm the unstaking transaction by clicking **"Confirm"**

![Solflare Now Unstaking Status](/shared/images/jitosol/solfare-unstake-sol-active-sol-now-unstaking-step-4.png)

After confirmation, your stake will show as **"Unstaking"** with a countdown timer.

**Note:** Unstake each active stake account individually.

## Step 6: Wait for Epoch Completion

**Waiting Period:** Up to 2 days (1 Solana epoch)

Stakes need to cool down due to Solana protocol requirements. Check status in Solflare. Once showing **"Unstaked"**, they're ready to withdraw.

## Step 7: Withdraw Your SOL

Once your stakes show as **"Unstaked"**:

![Solflare Unstaked SOL Ready](/shared/images/jitosol/solfare-unstake-sol-inactive-sol-step-1a.png)

Your stake will show as **"Unstaked"** when available for withdrawal.

![Solflare Withdraw Interface](/shared/images/jitosol/solfare-unstake-sol-inactive-sol-withdraw-step-2a.png)

1. Click **"Withdraw"** to start the withdrawal process
2. Review the withdrawal details (token amount, destination, network fees)
