#### Step 4: Authorize Solflare to Connect

Click "Connect" to Authorize Solflare to communicate with our site. You may opt to "Trust this app" to prevent future connection requests. It is purely a convenience feature and not required to connect nor receive JitoSOL.

Afterwards, you can confirm your wallet is connected by checking the address in the top right corner of the page (as shown below)

### Step 5: Choose Amount to Stake as JitoSOL

Enter the amount you wish to deposit into JitoSOL in the screen on the right. Ensure the amount is less than your total balance. You should also keep some SOL in your wallet (at least 0.1) for subsequent transaction fees.

Confirm the amount in Solflare reflects the amount you want to deposit. Then click "Approve".

There should be a pop-up at the button of the screen confirming the operation.

This will pop-up at the bottom of your interface.

#### Step 5: Confirm receipt of JitoSOL

Check your wallet and you should see Jito Staked SOL in the amount you chose to stake.

*Note: the caution sign is because JitoSOL is recently issued. Read *[*here*](https://app.gitbook.com/o/HvXfMMBYPChYJzhzKG1h/s/p7fdQASNHD4egpjwd960/~/changes/IlAgqunpRrYzaTygAAP1/faqs/solflare-token-alert)* for further details.*
