subtitle: 'Leading Solana lending protocol with $400M+ TVL and JitoSOL integration'
---

marginfi is one of Solana's largest lending protocols with over $400 million in deposits. The platform offers lending, borrowing, and leveraged staking strategies using JitoSOL as collateral.

## JitoSOL Integration

marginfi supports JitoSOL with competitive loan-to-value ratios and yield opportunities.

## Core Strategies

**Basic Lending**
1. Deposit JitoSOL to earn interest + points
2. Maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards
3. Borrow assets against JitoSOL collateral (up to 77% LTV)

**Leveraged Staking (Advanced)**

The Loop Strategy:
1. Deposit JitoSOL as collateral
2. Borrow SOL against JitoSOL value  
3. Convert borrowed SOL to more JitoSOL
4. Repeat process to amplify exposure

**Example**:
- Start with 100 JitoSOL
- Borrow 70 SOL (70% LTV)
- Convert to ~57 more JitoSOL  
- Total position: ~157 JitoSOL
- **Amplified yield**: Earn on 157 JitoSOL instead of 100
- **Cost**: SOL borrowing rate (~7.7%)
