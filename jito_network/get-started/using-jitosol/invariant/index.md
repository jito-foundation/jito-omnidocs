Invariant offers several [concentrated liquidity](https://docs.invariant.app/docs/what_is/concentrated_liquidity) pools including JitoSOL tokens. Liquidity providers in these pools will earn the staking and MEV rewards from JitoSOL in addition to trading fees associated with pool transactions.

To supply JitoSOL liquidity to Invariant, go to their [site](https://invariant.app/pool) and deposit JitoSOL along with the another token. Here is their [tutorial](https://docs.invariant.app/docs/how_to_add_remove_liquidity). Consider pairing JitoSOL with mSOL or stSOL if you want to earn staking rewards on both assets plus trading fees with minimal risk of impermanent loss.

Please read through Invariant [documentation](https://docs.invariant.app/docs/) and understand all the risks prior to using their protocol.
