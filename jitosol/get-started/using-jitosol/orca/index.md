JitoSOL has many Orca liquidity pools for yield farming. See the full list [here](https://www.orca.so/whirlpools/browse?tokenMint=J1toso1uCk3RLmjorhTtrVwY9HJ7X8V9yYac6Y7kGCPn).

To provide liquidity in these pools, navigate to [Orca](https://www.orca.so/whirlpools/browse?tokenMint=J1toso1uCk3RLmjorhTtrVwY9HJ7X8V9yYac6Y7kGCPn), connect your wallet and select your preferred pool.

The pools are setup as Whirlpools, which require a user-defined price range. Orca will suggest a range when depositing. Less active traders should consider the "Passive" option suggested by Orca. Read more on Whirlpools price [ranges](https://docs.orca.so/orca-for-liquidity-providers/master#how-are-the-preset-price-ranges-calculated-and-how-do-you-create-a-custom-range).

After depositing, you will begin earning fees on JitoSOL trades in addition to the token's staking and MEV yield. Jito cannot endorse Orca. Please do your own research and understand the risks of liquidity provision prior to any deposit.

Kamino offers an actively managed vault ontop of whirlpools. That may be a good option for more passive yield farming. Read more at this link.
