#### Go to [jito.network](https://www.jito.network/staking) and follow the instructions below!

### **Setup Wallet**

The first step is having a wallet with SOL tokens. JitoSOL is currently integrated with the wallets shown below. If you don't have an existing wallet, we recommend setting up with Phantom ([setup instructions](https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/8071074929043-How-to-create-a-new-wallet)) or Solflare ([instructions](https://solflare.com/)).Current wallet integrations

### **Ledger Integration**

JitoSOL is fully compatible with Ledger wallets used through browser extensions. Follow the instructions and approve the transactions when prompted on your device after clicking "Accept" in your browser wallet.

### **Acquire SOL for Staking**

Your wallet also needs some balance of SOL to stake. If you want to purchase SOL and already have assets in your wallet, use [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) to swap for SOL.For those without existing assets on Solana, SOL can be purchased through exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or most popular venues. After purchasing SOL and setting up a Solana wallet (see above), transfer the SOL into your wallet.

### Connect Wallet to Jito
