# Introduction to Jito Governance

The Jito governance system enables community-driven decision making for the Jito ecosystem. Through this system, token holders and community members can propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol.

## Governance Principles

Jito's governance is built on the following principles:

- **Transparency**: All governance actions are publicly visible and auditable
- **Inclusivity**: Anyone holding governance tokens can participate
- **Security**: Multi-layered security measures protect the governance process
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes enable timely decision-making

## Key Components

The Jito governance system consists of several key components:

### Governance Token

The Jito governance token (JITO) is used for voting on proposals. Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held or delegated.

### Proposal System

The proposal system allows community members to submit proposals for protocol changes. Proposals go through several stages before implementation:

1. **Discussion**: Initial community discussion
2. **Formal Proposal**: Submission of a formal proposal
3. **Voting**: Community voting period
4. **Execution**: Implementation of approved proposals

### Governance Council

The Governance Council consists of elected representatives who oversee the governance process. The council can expedite emergency proposals and ensure the system operates smoothly.

## Getting Started

To participate in Jito governance:

1. **Acquire JITO Tokens**: Purchase or earn JITO tokens
2. **Set Up a Wallet**: Configure a compatible wallet for governance actions
3. **Join the Community**: Participate in discussions on the Jito forum and Discord
4. **Vote or Delegate**: Vote directly on proposals or delegate your voting power
