## Understanding the DeFi Page

The [jito.network/defi](https://www.jito.network/defi/) page displays third-party DeFi protocols where JitoSOL is supported.

**⚠️ Important Disclaimers:**
- All DeFi activities involve significant risks including potential total loss of funds
- This information is educational only and not financial advice
- Jito does not endorse, recommend, or guarantee any third-party protocols
- Always do your own research before using any DeFi protocol
- Past performance does not indicate future results

### What You'll Find

**Various Strategies** across major DeFi categories - from simple lending to complex yield farming setups.

**Quick Filters:** 
- **Strategy type** - Lending, Liquidity Pools, Looping, Restaking
- **Protocol** - Filter by specific platforms (Kamino, Drift, etc.)
- **JTO Boost** - Strategies with additional JTO token rewards

**Live Data:**
Each protocol shows real TVL, so you can see which strategies have the most activity. The green "JTO Boost" badges highlight where you can earn extra JTO tokens on top of base rewards.

## Strategy Breakdown

### Borrow/Lend (Simple Start)
**The concept:** Lend your JitoSOL to earn interest, or use it as collateral to borrow other tokens.

**Popular on:** Drift, Solend, MarginFi - protocols with $10M+ TVL typically offer more stable rates.

**Watch out for:** Liquidation if you're borrowing. Interest rates can spike during market stress.

### Liquidity Pools (Trading Fees)
**The concept:** Pair JitoSOL with another token (like SOL or JTO) so traders can swap between them. You earn a cut of trading fees.

**Biggest pools:** JitoSOL/SOL pairs dominate with $35M+ TVL. JitoSOL/JTO and other pairs are also active.

**The catch:** "Impermanent loss" - if one token outperforms the other significantly, you might end up with less value than just holding.

### Looping (Advanced)
**The concept:** Automatically borrow against your JitoSOL to buy more JitoSOL, amplifying both gains and losses.

**Risk level:** High. Market drops get magnified, potentially triggering liquidations.

### Restaking (Cutting Edge)
**The concept:** Your JitoSOL secures additional networks beyond Solana, earning extra rewards.

**Current leader:** Jito's own restaking with $200M+ TVL. Still relatively new with additional technical risks.

## The Reality Check

**⚠️ DeFi can be unforgiving.** Even "safe" protocols have seen major losses from hacks, governance attacks, and market crashes.

**Common ways things go wrong:**
- **Smart contracts get exploited** - bugs in code can drain funds instantly
- **Liquidations during volatility** - your collateral gets sold when markets move fast
- **Governance attacks** - protocol changes that hurt users
- **Bridge hacks** - cross-chain transfers are particularly vulnerable

**The TVL game:** High TVL doesn't mean safe - some of the biggest protocols have had the largest exploits. But extremely low TVL often signals untested code.

**Important:** This page shows third-party protocols. Jito doesn't control them, audit them, or guarantee anything about them. Each has its own risks, terms, and team.

## Before You Dive In

**Do your homework:**
- Read the protocol's docs (not just the marketing page)
- Check recent audit reports - look for "High" or "Critical" findings
- Browse their Discord/Twitter for recent drama or issues
- Use [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com) to track TVL trends and yields

**Start small:** Even experienced DeFi users lose money regularly. Treat your first positions as education.
