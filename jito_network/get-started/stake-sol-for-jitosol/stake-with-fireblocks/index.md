JitoSOL's is integrated with Fireblocks for secure institutional custody. 

- The [jito.network](https://www.jito.network/staking) site enables minting directly from Fireblocks. Select WalletConnect and pair using the Fireblocks app. Note, Fireblocks has not upgraded many customers to WalletConnect v2, which is required for usage. If you get "Error: Unable to init wallet, please try again later", your account is likely using the wrong WalletConnect version. Open a ticket with customer service and they can switch your service in an hour.
- Follow the traditional workflow on [jito.network](https://www.jito.network/staking) and assets will be minted to your account.
- JitoSOL is included in the Fireblocks asset list and it will be shown like SOL or any other SPL token.

Please open a ticket in our discord if any issues. Jito maintains a Fireblocks account and can provide real-time support through the process.
