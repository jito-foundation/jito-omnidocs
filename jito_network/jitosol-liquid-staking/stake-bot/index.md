Over time, as people deposit SOL into the reserve, or as validator performance varies, it becomes necessary to move stake around. Jito develops and maintains an automated system called <code>Kobe</code>, which stores network information about validators and the network, and delegates stake according to each validator. This code is open source and heavily inspired by Solana's Stake-o-matic [program](https://docs.solana.com/staking/stake-programming#stake-o-matic-aka-auto-delegation-bots).

The stake-bot will soon be source and we will provide additional detail on its structure.
