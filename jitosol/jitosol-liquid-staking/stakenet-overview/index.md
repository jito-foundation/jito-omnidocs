## What is StakeNet?

Stakenet is Jito's automated stake pool management system that combines on-chain programs with off-chain services to optimize JitoSOL's validator selection and stake distribution.

### Key characteristics:

**On-chain decision making**  
The Steward and Validator History programs manage stake allocation decisions directly on Solana, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

**Community governance**  
All system parameters can be adjusted through Jito DAO governance, allowing the community to influence delegation criteria and safety mechanisms.

**Decentralized execution**  
Multiple independent keepers execute the system's decisions, removing single points of failure while maintaining network health and optimal yields.
