This guide covers how to stake SOL for JitoSOL using Phantom wallet. The process takes just a few minutes and allows you to start earning both staking and MEV rewards.

**Time Required:** 2-5 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Phantom wallet with SOL tokens and small amount for transaction fees

## Prerequisites

### **Getting SOL for Staking**

Your wallet needs some balance of SOL to stake. If you want to purchase SOL and already have assets in your wallet, use [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) to swap for SOL. For those without existing assets on Solana, SOL can be purchased through exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or most popular venues. After purchasing SOL and setting up a Solana wallet, transfer the SOL into your wallet.

### **Ledger Integration**

JitoSOL is fully compatible with Ledger wallets used through browser extensions. If you're using a Ledger with Phantom:
1. Connect your Ledger device to your computer
2. Open the Solana app on your Ledger
3. Use Phantom browser extension to connect to your Ledger
4. Follow the instructions and approve transactions on your Ledger device when prompted

## Step 1: Connect Your Phantom Wallet

Navigate to [jito.network/staking](https://jito.network/staking/) and connect your wallet:
