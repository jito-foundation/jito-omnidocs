#### Note: You will need to repeat this step for every account listed as "Active" or "Activating" in order to start the unstaking process.

### Step 6: Wait 2-4 days

The stake needs to be withdrawn from validators and there is a unstaking protocol implemented by Solana that lasts from 2-4 days. This applies for any staking method (read more [here](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/stake-delegation-and-rewards#stake-warmup-cooldown-withdrawal)). You can check in Phantom to see the stake status. Once "inactive", it can be withdrawn.

### Step 7: Withdraw SOL

Once your stake is listed as "Inactive", it is free to be withdrawn.

![Unstaking With Phantom 4](/shared/images/jito_network/Unstaking_With_Phantom_4.png)

Click on the stake account and select Withdraw Stake. After that, the stake should be converted into SOL in your account.
