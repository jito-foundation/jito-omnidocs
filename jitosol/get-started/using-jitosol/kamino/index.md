Kamino Finance has several vaults featuring JitoSOL. The largest are mSOL-JitoSOL (on Orca) and SOL-JitoSOL (on Raydium). Kamino integrates with Solana concentrated liquidity AMMs and manages the liquidity ranges to optimize volume with minimal impermeant loss.

You can access the vaults [here](https://app.kamino.finance/) and Kamino's documentation is [here](https://docs.kamino.finance/liquidity-vaults/liquidity-vault-overview).

### mSOL-JitoSOL Vault:

Pairing JitoSOL with another liquid staking token like mSOL enhances the overall yield offering. LPs earn staking rewards, MEV rewards and trading fees without the risk of impermanent loss.

While APY may seem low (1.5% in the above screenshot), this excludes the staking and MEV rewards earned on native JitoSOL and mSOL. Combined, yields should be 8% or more on SOL with no risk of impermeant loss since the asset prices are pegged roughly in line.

See more details in the announcement [article](https://blog.kamino.finance/jito-vault-onboarding/). Kamino's [docs](https://docs.kamino.finance/) include an [overview of their vaults](https://docs.kamino.finance/what-are-clmms) and a [getting started guide](https://docs.kamino.finance/get-started). Jito has not endorsed nor audited Kamino. As always, DYOR to understand risks and fees.
