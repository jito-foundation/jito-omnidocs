subtitle: 'Leading Solana lending protocol with $400M+ TVL and JitoSOL integration'
---

marginfi is one of Solana's largest and most established lending protocols with over $400 million in deposits. The platform offers lending, borrowing, and leveraged staking strategies using JitoSOL as collateral.

## JitoSOL Integration

marginfi fully supports JitoSOL with competitive loan-to-value ratios and yield opportunities.

## Core Strategies

### **Basic Lending**
1. **Deposit JitoSOL** to earn interest + points
2. **Maintain Liquidity** while earning staking rewards
3. **Borrow Assets** against JitoSOL collateral (up to 77% LTV)

### **Leveraged Staking (Advanced)**

marginfi enables sophisticated leveraged staking strategies:

**The Loop Strategy**:
1. Deposit JitoSOL as collateral
2. Borrow SOL against JitoSOL value  
3. Convert borrowed SOL to more JitoSOL
4. Repeat process to amplify exposure

**Example**:
- Start with 100 JitoSOL
- Borrow 70 SOL (70% LTV)
- Convert to ~57 more JitoSOL  
- Total position: ~157 JitoSOL
- **Amplified yield**: Instead of 7.5% on 100 JitoSOL, earn on 157 JitoSOL
- **Cost**: SOL borrowing rate (~7.7%)
