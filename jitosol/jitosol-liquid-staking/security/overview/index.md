jitoSOL is built on the stake pool program developed by Solana Labs. The program has been supporting numerous implementations since the network launched and three firms have completed audits ([reports](https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool#security-audits)).

Liquid staking is non-custodial so Jito does not have access to funds deposited in jitoSOL. Even if Jito were to disappear, holders could still withdraw their SOL from validators along with accumulated rewards.

Jito DAO has the manager role for the JitoSOL pool with limited responsibilities around validator selection and fees. Validator selection is run by StakeNet.
