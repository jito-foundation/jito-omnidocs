### Step 4: Authorize Solflare to Connect

Click "Connect" to Authorize Solflare to communicate with our site. You may opt to "Trust this app" to prevent future connection requests. It is purely a convenience feature and not required to connect nor receive JitoSOL.

### Step 7: Manually Undelegate the Accounts

You must undelegate each "Active" (or "Activating") account to being the withdrawal process. After clicking the account, you will see the below interface. Select Undelegate.

Confirm the undelegation when prompted.

![Unstaking with SolFlare 16](/shared/images/jito_network/Unstaking_with_SolFlare_16.png)

Your account will now be shown as Deactivating

#### Note: You will need to repeat this step for every account listed as "Active" or "Activating" in order to start the unstaking process.

### Step 8: Wait 2-4 days

The stake needs to be withdrawn from validators and there is a unstaking protocol implemented by Solana that lasts from 2-4 days. This applies for any staking method (read more [here](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/stake-delegation-and-rewards#stake-warmup-cooldown-withdrawal)). You can check in Solflare anytime to see the stake status. Once "inactive", it can be withdrawn.

### Step 9: Withdraw SOL

Your stake will be shown as Inactive when available for withdrawal.

![Unstaking with SolFlare 4](/shared/images/jito_network/Unstaking_with_SolFlare_4.png)

Select Withdraw to complete the process

![Unstaking with SolFlare 18](/shared/images/jito_network/Unstaking_with_SolFlare_18.png)

Decide how much you would like to withdraw. We recommend most users select "Withdraw everything and close account". This will maximize the SOL you receive.

![Unstaking with SolFlare 13](/shared/images/jito_network/Unstaking_with_SolFlare_13.png)

Confirm the withdrawal once you've decided how much to take out.

### Step 10: Use your SOL

You can confirm the withdrawal in your activity tab. Your unstaked amount will be included in the SOL balance in your wallet.
